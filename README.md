### TrackMap course project made amidst The Complete JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann [Mapty].

## Functionalities:
- User can view their current location on a map.
- Can mark their workout/ cycling location on the map by dropping a pin
- User can enter details such as distance, time, elevation-gain, etc along with the pain
- The pins will be saved in the local storage and can be retrieved upon refreshing
- Info will be shown in the UI and a compact pin will stay on the map.
